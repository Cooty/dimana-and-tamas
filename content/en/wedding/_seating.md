We believe in fostering a warm and relaxed atmosphere, which is why dinner will feature free seating. That means that we’ll have **reserved tables for family and family friends**, and **grouped tables for friends**, reflecting our Bulgarian, Hungarian, and international backgrounds.

While we'll offer suggestions based on these relationships and nationalities, ultimately, **the choice is yours**.

And don't worry – there will be plenty of seats for everyone!

**So relax, mingle, and enjoy the festivities to the fullest!**
