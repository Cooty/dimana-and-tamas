The wedding is scheduled for **September 7th**, and we kindly request your presence **no later than 17:00** on that day at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SWhLCrfHW72n8nu38" target="_blank">Maritime Station</a> for the ferry to the island.

However, If the weather is nice, we are considering having an **evening cocktail get-together** for our early guests in Burgas on the **night before the wedding, September 6th**. Details will follow by email.

We hope that you will understand that the days before the wedding will be quite hectic for us. If you plan to spend more quality time with us (and we would love that!), we recommend adding some **extra days after the wedding rather than before it** when we will be more relaxed. We are not planning to go on a honeymoon immediately after the celebration, so it would be wonderful to chill together and reminisce about how great the party was!
