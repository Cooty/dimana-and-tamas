## Parking on the street

In a nutshell, there are three types of zones in Burgas, as you can also see on <a target="_blank" href="https://m.travelburgas.eu/bg/blue-zone">this interactive map of parking places and zones</a>.

<a href="https://www.transportburgas.bg/en/burgas-blue-zone-rules" target="_blank">**Blue Zone**</a>

- _1 BGN per hour_
- Weekdays (_except national holidays_) _9:00 to 19:00_

The good thing in the case of our wedding parking in the **Blue Zones is free**, because it's on the weekend plus **Friday, September 6th is also free** as it's a national holiday.

- _1 BGN per hour_.
- Active period: Summer season (_May 1st to September 30th_).
- Operational hours: From _11:00 to 20:00_, Monday to Sunday, **regardless of National holidays**.

This might affect you if you are staying or parking next to the **Sea Garden**, the **Port**, or **Lazur neighborhood**.

**Yellow Zone**

It is a fancy way to indicate that _parking is free_.<br>
Essentially, there are no specific rules for parking in this zone. However, the downside is that these areas are often crowded and over-parked, particularly if they are adjacent to the City Center.

**How to pay?**

Send an SMS with your license plate to _1356_.
<br/>A rate for an hour will be arranged by your mobile operator.

## Private Parking Places

If you arrive with your own car and seek a secure place to leave it while exploring Burgas on foot, paid parking is available. This option is particularly useful if your hotel does not provide parking facilities.

The most convenient locations are <a href="https://www.gotoburgas.com/en/more/view/259" target="_blank">Parking “Gurko”</a> on Gurko Street, ideal if you are closer to the Center, or Parking <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/e8zex5bBRy9CWPMe7" target="_blank">“Magazia 1”</a>, suitable if you are staying nearer to the Sea Port, Central Railway, or Bus stations.
