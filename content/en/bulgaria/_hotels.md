Burgas is not a large city, and the center is easily accessible even from the periphery. However, we recommend **choosing accommodations in the center for the best Burgas experience** and a convenient access to everything within walking distance.

Here are some recommendations for **hotels in Burgas**, provided by our local friends. Please note that we have not stayed at these hotels ourselves, so we advise you to conduct your own research before booking:
